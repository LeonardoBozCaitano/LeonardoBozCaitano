I'm a 5+ years experienced Brazilian software engineer and a technology lover, always searching for personal and professional growth. I found at Backend engineering what really makes me keep excited to work, learn, and grow every day. During my career, I have worked with Java, Golang and several other technologies. I have really good soft skills and experience with project management and teamwork.

I have professional experience in:
- Backend development: Java (My main technology) and Golang.
- Messaging: RabbitMQ, AWS SNS and SQS, Kafka.
- Databases: PL/SQL, Postgres, Oracle, MongoDB.
- Cloud: AWS (EC2, ELB, RDS, SNS, SES, SQS, S3, Route53, VPC, AutoScaling, IAM, KMS) and Terraform to provide infrastructure.
- Unit tests, integration tests and functionality tests.
- CI/CD: Github Actions, Jenkins, Gitlab Pipelines.
- Agile methodologies: Kanban and Scrum.
- Frontend development: Angular, React, and NextJS. (HTML, CSS)
