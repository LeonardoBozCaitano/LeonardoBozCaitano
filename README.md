## Hello! âš—

I'm a 5+ years experienced Brazilian software engineer and a technology lover, always searching for personal and professional growth. I found at Backend engineering what really makes me keep excited to work, learn, and grow every day. During my career, I have worked with Java, Golang and several other technologies.
